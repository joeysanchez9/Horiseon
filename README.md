# Code Refactor Starter Code
Module 1 

Description
The motivation behind this project was to learn how to create a clear and concise html file anyone can understand.  With the outlined notes and format, it is easy to understand and follow.  The CSS file also had multiple repetative lines, so those were consolidated to show the same attributes.  The HTML file uses symantec HTML tags that will help with search engine optimization.


Usage
Each section contains notes about each topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
